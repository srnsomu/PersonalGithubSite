This April has probably been my most busiest and productive month 
ever.

It was GSOC time. GSOC is... google it nub. I had been planning 
on participating in GSOC for a year now. However, I was quite confident I 
didn't have have the required skills. I was told to atleast give it a try by the \#h-i-ers. So I started scouting around. After a lot of searching, 
I realized the only thing I knew was Python + a little bit of 
GUI.

And then I found PiTiVi on the GNOME ideas page. I hanged around 
\#pitivi and had a look at their wiki. Thankfully, it was built on py + gtk (+ 
gst). So I had a look through their idea and bug lists and submitted the 
proposal. I must have slept for around 4.5 hours at night that week. The rest 
I compensated for at college :)

And then we had our "First Official 
\#c-h Alliance Round Table Conference" at Elliots Beach which was attended by 
all the regional Pirate/Ninja overlords. I met idlecool, Sup3rkiddo and 
Stattrav in person for the first time. I also got my first epic portrait with 
Sup3rkiddo's depreciated value DSLR. And then yuvi tells me I would need a 
patch to get into GNOME and I went into overdrive trying to find an easy 
bug.

YuviPanda wanted to do something semantic on MediaWiki, idlecool 
applied for Sahana and gsathya applied for Orbot - TOR Android 
client.

I finally found 
[https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=608108](https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=608108). 
The only difficult part was finding the correct classes and functions. I 
submitted 2 patches which turned out to be "technically correct but wrong from 
the user's perspective". So I went back and just modified it a little bit and 
Voila! it worked. I submitted the patch and it officially became my *FIRST 
PATCH EVAAAH*.

This whole month, I don't remember studying anything 
at home and apart from doing my record work, I didn't touch my college books. 
Now I have to get back to my books as the end sem exam is approaching. As of 
writing this post, GSOC acceptance is 1 day, 11 hours, 53 minutes and 
11 seconds away and gsathya is feeling extremely anxious and tensed :P.  I'm 
feeling quite calm. \#h-i also looks surprisingly peaceful.
