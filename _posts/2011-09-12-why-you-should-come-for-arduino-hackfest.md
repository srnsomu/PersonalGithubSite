<blockquote>This is regarding the IITM Shaastra Arduino HackFest - 
[http://www.shaastra.org/2011/main/events/Hackfest/](http://www.shaastra.org/2011/main/events/Hackfest/). 
It got repetitive telling my friends what an Arduino is and what goes on at 
HackFest. This would be useful for anyone who wants to learn how to quickly 
connect do cool stuff like blink LEDs, read temperatures, design bots and 
toys.</blockquote><br/><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-46"

**What is HackFest 
?**

It is a 3 "night" event held during IITM Shaastra. It is one of 
the much awaited geek events in Chennai. A lot of students turn up to get 
started with programming and contributing to opensource. It is usually held 
near a weekend, so this year, it *might* be 30th, 1st and 2nd. The 
introductory talks explaining the basics might happen in the evening. But most 
of the "hacking" happens between 2200 to 0400. So it is a midnight workshop 
:P. Last year, I attended for a day and chickened out due to fatigue. Make 
sure you don't return home on the first day or you will probably give up 
too.

The Arduino HackFest would be conducted by Priya Kuber -

Don't be afraid :P

 

**What is Arduino ?**

Google 
has the best answers -

An Arduino is simply an electronic board 
which is very simple and easy to work with. It provides a very user-friendly 
way to program micro-controllers. You can program an LED to blink at your 
command in a few minutes if you are familiar with *basic* C. The Arduino Uno 
board costs around Rs. 1500.

It has a HUGE online community and fan 
following. You can always look up the forums for help and ideas.

 


**What can I use it for ?**

You can use it to build a 
gajillion awesome electronic toys/pranks/devices.

These are some of 
the cool stuff students have made -

Apart 
from this, it will also come in useful for your final year project and any 
robotics related competition. Maybe next year, you can participate in 
[http://www.shaastra.org/2011/main/events/Aerobotics/](http://www.shaastra.org/2011/main/events/Aerobotics/) 
and 
[http://www.shaastra.org/2011/main/events/Robowars/](http://www.shaastra.org/2011/main/events/Robowars/).

You 
can also apply what is being thought in college. You can learn how servos 
work, try out logic gates, build your own virtual CRO, etc. The possibilities 
are limitless.<br/><blockquote>At Yahoo OpenHack 2011, Banglore, I built a TV 
remote controlled LED/bulb. Using just the Arduino, a resistor, an IR Photo 
detector module, Ken Shirriff's IR library and a random TV remote, we built a 
circuit which switches ON LED if you press channel 1 and switches it OFF for 
0. All this in just around half an hour. And I had ZERO previous experience. 
This is considered an extremely simple circuit !</blockquote><br/>**Â How do I 
participate ?**

Go to 
[http://www.shaastra.org/2011/main/events/Hackfest/](http://www.shaastra.org/2011/main/events/Hackfest/) 
-&gt; "Event Format" -&gt; 
[Questionnaire_arduino.doc](http://www.shaastra.org/2011/media/main/events/Hackfest/files/HackFestQuestionnaire_arduino.doc). 
Fill that up and save as a PDF and upload it according to instructions under 
"Registration". <em>Make sure you apply for accomodation... just in 
case</em>.

The questions are fairly easy and google is your best 
friend. This isn't a competitive event. No fixed number of seats and such. You 
just have to learn to google your questions in the correct words. HackFest is 
not school where they spoon-feed you. One single mentor cannot possibly go 
around and personally teach 60 participants. You'll have to look up stuff 
online or discuss with friends... you know.. like *actual* college. So please 
don't just rip off answers from a friend. Look around and find it. The 
deadline is 18th September so hurry !

The cost would be around Rs 
1000 for the hardware. You can take the Arduino Board home. **This is not a 
certificate course. Heck, I don't even think they give out "participation 
certificates" so resume padders, FO.**

And you will also get to meet 
Chennai's GSoC-ers xD

A few guys from 2nd year VEC would definitely 
be attending it. Moar the merrier !
