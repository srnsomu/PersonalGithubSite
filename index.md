I am an engineer working with the product development team of Philips Healthcare. It's a role where I get to combine my engineering and product development expertise with my passion for medicine to create breakthrough new products.

I completed my masters degree at the Integrated Innovation Institute, Carnegiew Mellon university and my Bachelors in Engineering from Bangalore, India.

I enjoy working on projects at the intersection of electronics, computer science and medicine. My other passions include playing squash, trivia clubs, working out and public speaking.

__Eye movement based computer interaction using Electrooculogram__

![alt text]({{ site.url }}/assets/ti_adc.png)

* Designed a circuit to capture Electrooculogram (EOG) signals resulting from corneo-retinal potential using electrodes placed around the eyes.
* EOG signal was amplified and filtered to remove power-line, skin-contact noise and
other interference and transmitted to the computer
