Hey!

I'm a roboticist pursuing my masters degree at the Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon University. Previously, I was a research intern at the *Robotics Research Center, IIIT Hyderabad*.

I enjoy working on projects at the intersection of electronics, computer science and medicine. When I'm not working, I'm working out. I also enjoy photography, visiting new cities and hiking. I also own and operate a medical diagnostic center in Chennai.

My awesome days as an undergrad at *Velammal Engineering College, Chennai* shall never be forgotten!

Feel free to contact me at ferozenaina [at] gmail [dot] com.

__Eye movement based computer interaction using Electrooculogram__

![alt text]({{ site.url }}/assets/ti_adc.png)

* Designed a circuit to capture Electrooculogram (EOG) signals resulting from corneo-retinal potential using electrodes placed around the eyes.
* EOG signal was amplified and filtered to remove power-line, skin-contact noise and
other interference and transmitted to the computer
